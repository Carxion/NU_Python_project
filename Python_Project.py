print("please enter prospective Password. Include 16 characters, Uppercase and lowercase letters, Numbers, and special characters, no dictionary words")

Pass = input("Enter here:")
# Password will be stored in pass variable
# create rules that meet certain strong password criteria
# for example:
#if pass has no Upper case letters = return that password needs uppercase letters
# if pass has no lowercase letters = return that password needs lowercase letters
# if string contains no numbers = return that password needs numbers
# if string contains no special characters = return that password needs special characters
# if string contains dictionary words = return that password cannot be dictionary words\\
#if string is less than 16 characters= return that password needs to be 16 characters or more
# must def each of these as functions that will run and return if a password is valid. once meets all criteria can spit out that password successfully meets criteria
